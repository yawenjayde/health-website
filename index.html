    <h5> Thoughts and Review </h5>
    <p> Healthy foods are a must for a healthy lifestyle so it was really nice to make a healthy recipe based on what I had at home, cream cheese, tuna, mayo, and cucumbers. Having a nutritious snack is definitely something I need to have as a habit now since I mostly eat chips and candy when I’m craving for something to eat but don’t know what. Its also a habit of mine to eat while doing basically anything. From doing homework and watching shows to eating while cooking and also during night time which isn't good for you because of the fact that it won’t digest and will make you gain more weight.  Cucumbers are healthy since they have low calories but rich in antioxidants and fiber as well as promoting bone, skin, and heart health. The tuna and cream cheese are high in protein which is important for muscle repair, overall cell health, and is also good at making you feel full, making it a great way to manage your weight. While making this snack, honestly, in my opinion, I think it was a bit difficult at first but after a few trials and errors, it became easier to make. The video I made was my first attempt so I couldn't get things straight. I made way too much sauce and used a bit too much cucumber. Although my whole recipe was a big failure, I chose to look at the bright side, thinking that I’ll learn from these mistakes to make an even better recipe!  </p>
